# Social Network API

## Description
- The main objective of this challenge was to uild an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.
- In addition to the above, we were tasked with being able to use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
- I learned how to use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
- I also learned how to queue up various routes in insomnia.

## Installation & Usage:
- Clone the repository on github locally.
- Install node modules through the command 'npm install'
- Start the server using 'npm start' and open up insomnia
- In insomnia, navigate to http://localhost:3001/api/users to see all users. You can replace users with other end points to see their respective data.
